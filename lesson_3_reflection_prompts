      Making changes in master indicates that you are sure about them and that they work properly and without bugs. Also it means that all the other people working on the project are aware of the changes and they approve them completely. So making changes in a new branch leaves master as it is (safe and working) and the changes can be reviued by the team approved and then merge in the master branch
